# Sentiment Natural Language Processing Model
## Project Purpose
This project is to build a basic NLP model that can perform the sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining or emotion AI, uses the NLP model to identify and quantify the human emotions portraited from the given texts. This model is expected to provide quantified emotion level scales from 1 through 5, 1 being the most dissatisfied state, and 5 being the most satisfied state.
