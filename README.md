Natural Language Processing Model based on RNN - LSTM Model

Abstract
Long Short Term Memory model expands the model's memory capacity to accommodate a longer timeline. An RNN can only remember the immediate past input, whereas LSTM model learns from several previous sequences to improve the prediction outputs.
Natural Language Processing is a type of LSTM model that processes the natural language patterns, applying the predicted output words given the input words.
